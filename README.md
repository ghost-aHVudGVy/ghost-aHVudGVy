I'm an IT Support professional who enjoys helping people solve technical problems and keeping systems running smoothly. I work with Windows, Active Directory, Microsoft 365, remote support tools, and ticketing systems, and I troubleshoot software, hardware, and network issues efficiently.

I get satisfaction from solving problems, keeping users productive, and learning new skills every day. I have hands-on experience with user account management, GPO configuration, printer setups, and remote diagnostics. On top of that, I completed programming courses in Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS through SoftUni, which strengthened my problem-solving and technical thinking.

Right now, I'm focused on growing my experience in Help Desk / IT Support roles while also exploring cybersecurity to broaden my skillset.
