# Hi, I'm Antonio

I'm an **IT Support professional** with hands-on experience helping users solve technical problems and keeping systems running smoothly. Skilled in **Windows, Active Directory, Microsoft 365, remote support tools, and ticketing systems**, I troubleshoot software, hardware, and network issues efficiently.  

I enjoy **solving problems, keeping users productive, and learning continuously**. I’m organized, reliable, and have practical experience in **user account management, GPO configuration, printer setups, and remote diagnostics**. I’ve also completed programming courses in **Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS through SoftUni**, which strengthened my problem-solving and technical thinking skills.  

I’m currently building my experience in **Help Desk / IT Support roles** while exploring **cybersecurity hands-on labs** to grow professionally.
