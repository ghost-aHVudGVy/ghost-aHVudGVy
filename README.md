I’m an IT Support professional with hands-on experience helping users solve technical problems and keeping systems running smoothly. I’ve worked with Windows, Active Directory, Microsoft 365, remote support tools, and ticketing systems, and I’m confident troubleshooting everything from software and hardware issues to network problems.

I enjoy troubleshooting issues, ensuring users can work smoothly, and resolving problems efficiently. I’m organized, focused, and persistent, with practical experience in user account management, Group Policy configuration, printer setups, and remote diagnostics. I’ve also completed programming courses in Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS through SoftUni, which strengthened my problem-solving and technical thinking skills.

I’m seeking a Help Desk / IT Support role where I can contribute immediately, bring value to the team, and continue growing as a professional. I’m excited to hit the ground running and help your team succeed.
